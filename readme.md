# Blog API | Server Side Javascript Project - Module 5

### Description

Endpoints:
/posts delivers posts

This is a simple Node.js server using Express to deliver data. It uses express router to define /posts and has a Post schema. It also uses MongoDB connected with Mongoose.

This API is hosted on a free dyno on Heroku, so if the data doesn't show immediately, that's because the free dynos are put to sleep when not in use and sometimes take half a minute to start up.

The live version of this repo is here:

You can send a post request with Postman f.e. using the Post schema in /models to try it out, your post will be available on the dummy frontend for this project:
